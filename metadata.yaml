  Charm for configuring Grafana Agent to ship telemetry to Grafana Cloud.

  This charm allows the administrator to configure upstream endpoints, as well
  as credentials, for shipping telemetry from a Juju deployed Grafana Agent
  to Grafana Cloud.

  
  This charm is useful when running the stack on-premise isn't desired, or
  when an additional off-premise storage is used for redundancy.

  This charm is useful for juju administrators who want to leverage the
  observability relations provided by COS for use with Grafana Cloud.
