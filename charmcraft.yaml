summary: Configures Grafana Agent to ship telemetry to Grafana Cloud.

  Charm for configuring Grafana Agent to ship telemetry to Grafana Cloud.

  This charm allows the administrator to configure upstream endpoints, as well
  as credentials, for shipping telemetry from a Juju deployed Grafana Agent
  to Grafana Cloud.

  
  This charm is useful when running the stack on-premise isn't desired, or
  when an additional off-premise storage is used for redundancy.

  This charm is useful for juju administrators who want to leverage the
  observability relations provided by COS for use with Grafana Cloud.
